 This heatmap is filterd by gender and it is obvious to tell that this is a male dominated service from the data results.
 
      **Data based on Usertype**

 This data is filtered by Usertype, which are customers or subscribers. A customer is a one off customer that may use it. A subscriber is a frequent user of the service and may have an account set up. The male demographic has the most subscriber using the service often.
 
 
**Summary**

  The data shows males seem to find the most value out of this service and may provide a market niche for the company to pursue. I would collect more data and see total number of subscribers to see if majority of my subscribers are men and then I would like to see how many women subscribers I have in order to access for valuble the woman demographic finds citibike service. This would then allow me to check to see why are people using citibike for example: do they use it for excercising, do they use it to commute, or simply easy transportation for sightseeing. This type of data would be helpful for the company to see how they can advance thier service and create new ways for the customer base to find value in the service.
